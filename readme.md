# ViteClout
----

ViteClout was built by myself and [JithinKS97](https://github.com/JithinKS97/)

This is our submission for Grants Round 12 Hackathon: Social Token Project (ViteClout)

This submission will likely not be complete, but should give a very good representation of the core features and functionality for viteClout, in regards to interacting with the database, twitter authenticationand, viteConnect and vite protocol.

This Project is built with React on the frontend and uses MongoDB to keep a database of current Vuilders. ViteClout Vuilders can update profile information and profile pictures.

This project utilizes the following repositories:

1. [ViteClout Server](https://github.com/JithinKS97/viteclout-server)
2. [ViteConnect Client](https://github.com/vitelabs/vite-connect-client)
3. [ViteConnect Server](https://github.com/vitelabs/vite-connect-server)
